# Changelog

## [1.2.0+1]

- Updated dependencies to the most recent versions

## [1.1.0]

- Changed the `get` method on endpoints to `fetch`. This has been done to preserve the `dart` keyword `get`.
- Changed the return turn for each endpoint to `WPResponse`. This changed was made to enable more control over the response returned and also get the necessary meta data returned from the response.
Refer to `example` or `README.md`

## [1.0.0]

### Breaking Changes/ What's New

As of v1+, every api `endpoint` is set to a `getter`. For example,

```dart
final WordPressAPI api = WordPressAPI('wp-site.domain');

// Getting posts the OLD WAY
final List<Post> posts = await api.getPosts();

// The new way as of v1.0+
final List<Post> posts = await api.posts.get();
```

The new way is applicable to `categories`, `pages`, `users`, `tags`, `taxonomies`, `media`, `application-passwords` and any other endpoints to be added.
